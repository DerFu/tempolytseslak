<h2>tempolytseslak?</h2>
<p>
  tempolytseslak? tempo lytse slak is friesischfor hurry up little slug or
  german Tempo kleine Schnecke. Tempo kleine Schnecke is a board game i played
  with my little son.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
  It was fun but not challenging. So while playing I asked what the distribution
  of winnings would be after many many many games. So I wanted to program the
  game and get statistics after many rounds.
