## tempolytseslak?

tempolytseslak? tempo lytse slak is `friesisch`for `hurry up little slug` or german `Tempo kleine Schnecke`. Tempo kleine Schnecke is a board game i played with my little son.

## Why?

It was fun but not challenging. So while playing I asked what the distribution of winnings would be after many many many games. So I wanted to program the game and get statistics after many rounds.
